          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-4">
            SyncFlix was born from a simple problem: staying connected with friends when life takes us in different directions. 
            As classmates found themselves in different classes and schools, we missed the experience of listening to music together 
            and sharing reactions in real-time.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-300">
            What started as a solution for friends separated by school schedules has grown into a platform that connects 
            people across distances, time zones, and life circumstances. Whether you're sharing the latest hits with a friend 
            who moved away or introducing your favorite classics to new friends, SyncFlix helps you create memories together.

          <p className="text-slate-300">
            We believe that music and videos are meant to be shared experiences. Our mission is to recreate the magic of 
            sitting in the same room with your friends, reacting to the same beats, laughing at the same moments, 
            and creating shared memoriesâ€”no matter where life takes you.
